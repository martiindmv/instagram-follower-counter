## **Project Description**

**Title:** Instagram Follower Counter

**Main Objective:** The project aims to develop a personal Instagram Follower Counter with a simple web-based interface. The primary functionality of the application is to retrieve data in JSON format and analyze the list of Instagram users who follow an individual against the list of users this individual follows. This will help to identify which users are not following back.

**Features:**
* Fetch and parse Instagram data in JSON format.
* Make the data importable via the web-based interface in order to be used by everyone.
* Compare "followers" and "following" lists.
* Identify non-reciprocal follow relationships.

**Authorship Clarification:**
